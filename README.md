# Player_vs_comp_card_game
Card game where player plays vs. computer.
Game is played with a pack of 20 cards (J, Q, K, 10, A). The cards have the following value:
Jack:  2
Queen: 3
King:  4
10:    10
Ace:   11
Each player gets five cards. The remaining cards are put in the stack. Every player puts one card on the table and the highest card win. Player who wins the round picks all cards from the table and puts them in his deck.
After each round players draw one card from the deck. Player who won the previous round is the one who draws first. If players put on the table the card of the same value we call it a draw and players must each draw one 
card from the stack and then put one more card on the table. The player who has the biggest card wins the round.
After the stack is gone the players continue to play until they are out of cards. When the players are out of cards the game is finished.
Winner is a player who has more points.
